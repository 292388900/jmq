/**
 * A class that can supply objects of a single type; a pre-Java-8 version of {@code
 * java.util.function.Supplier}. Semantically, this could be a factory, generator, builder,
 * closure, or something else entirely. No guarantees are implied by this interface.
 * <p>
 * <p>The {@link Suppliers} class provides common suppliers and related utilities.
 * <p>
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a href=
 * "https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/FunctionalExplained">the use of functional types</a>.
 * <p>
 * <h3>For Java 8+ users</h3>
 * <p>
 * <p>This interface is now a legacy type. Use {@code java.util.function.Supplier} (or the
 * appropriate primitive specialization such as {@code IntSupplier}) instead whenever possible.
 * Otherwise, at least reduce <i>explicit</i> dependencies on this type by using lambda expressions
 * or method references instead of classes, leaving your code easier to migrate in the future.
 * <p>
 * <p>To use an existing supplier instance (say, named {@code supplier}) in a config where the
 * <i>other type</i> of supplier is expected, use the method reference {@code supplier::get}. A
 * future version of {@code com.google.common.base.Supplier} will be made to <i>extend</i> {@code
 * java.util.function.Supplier}, making conversion code necessary only in one direction. At that
 * time, this interface will be officially discouraged.
